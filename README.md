### Dataset

Coming Soon

### Tests

We have made our test repositories used for the measurements public. Here are links to the repositories
QUIC tests: https://github.com/RohitPanda/Quic-Test
CPU Utilization: https://github.com/RohitPanda/CPU_utilization

### Analysis Reproducibility

You can access our analysis scripts from the `analysis-scripts` folder.

#### Requirements
The analyses were performed using `jupyter` notebooks on `Python 3`.
Required Python dependencies are listed as follows.

        Package          Version
        ipython          6.1.0
        matplotlib       2.1.0
        numpy            1.13.3
        pandas           00.3
        requests         2.18.4

For the calculation of CDFs and drawing of the corresponding plots, `Pmf.py` &rarr; and `Cdf.py` &rarr; from [Think Stats &rarr;](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) are used.
